# Implement Binary Search

In this problem, you have to implement binary search on a sorted array. 

Input:
> `Size of the array` 

>`The array elements`
>
>`The element to be searched `

Output: `The index of the searched element ` or   `-1 if it is not present in the array`.

##

### Examples:

Input: 

       5

       10 20 30 40 50

       30


Output: 

      2


Input: 

       5

       10 20 30 40 50

       70


Output: 

      -1

After you have stored in the input, the running time of your algorithm should be `O(log n)`.
