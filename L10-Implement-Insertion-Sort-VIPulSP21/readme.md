# Implement Insertion Sort

In this problem, given an `array as input` and you have to `perform insertion sort` and `output the sorted array` in non-decreasing order. Your goal is to output the contents of the array after each iteration of the insertion sort outer for/while loop (as done in the class)

Input: 
> The `number of elements` in the array.
>
> `The array`.

Output:
> The contents of the array after each iteration of the insertion sort algorithm
>

### Examples:

Input:
> 5
> 
> 4 6 2 8 5

Output:
>4 6 2 8 5
>
>2 4 6 8 5
>
>2 4 6 8 5
>
>2 4 5 6 8
>

Input:
>7
>
>7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
>6 7 5 4 3 2 1
>
>5 6 7 4 3 2 1
>
>4 5 6 7 3 2 1
>
>3 4 5 6 7 2 1
>
>2 3 4 5 6 7 1
>
>1 2 3 4 5 6 7
