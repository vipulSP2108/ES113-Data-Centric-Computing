This repository contains various assignments for the Data-centric Computing course, focused on implementing data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs in python programming languages and using them to solve problems. It also covers popular algorithms, such as sorting, searching and graph traversal.Â It also includes solutions made by me. 

Each assignment has its folder with multiple files, including a problem statement and readme file that provides a detailed explanation of the question; it provides an input and output format. An example input is given along with the expected output.

This repository also includes solutions to these assignments in the main.py file. 

Have fun coding!
