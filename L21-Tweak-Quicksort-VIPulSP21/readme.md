# Tweak-Quicksort

It so happens that you can `tweak quicksort and find the k-th smallest element in the array`. That is, there is `no need to sort the array` and then `find the element at index k`. Can you tweak the quicksort algorithm?

You are given an `array of size n` 
.
You must tweak quicksort to find the k-th smallest element.

Input: The `first line` contains an integer `n`
`The second line` contains `n space-separated integers` of the array, The `third line` contains the `k` for which you have to find the `k-th smallest element`.

Output: Print the `k-th smallest element` in the array.

Input :

>5

>10 21 5 1 3

>3

Output : 

>5
