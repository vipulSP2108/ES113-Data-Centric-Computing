# Delete from the beginning of a list
In this problem, we have written a partial implementation of the class Linked-List that inserts elements at the start of the list. You have to write a function `delete_front` in the class that deletes element from the beginning of the linked list.

 Assume the initial list is ` 23 11 2 8 7 4 13`. This list will be given in the code provided in the input.

 Input : The number of elements to be deleted from the beginning of the list `n`. 

Output: The list after `n` elements are deleted from the list. The `n` is more than the number of elements in the list, print `-1`. You can assume that only positive numbers will be added to the list.

Input:`1`

Output :`11 2 8 7 4 13`



Input : `3`

Output :`8 7 4 13`


Input :`8`

Output :`-1`
