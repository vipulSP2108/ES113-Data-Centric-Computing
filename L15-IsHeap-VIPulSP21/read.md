# Is Heap Sort
You are given an array `arr ` of integers of length `n`. Write a function that takes in the array as an argument and returns `1` if the array represents a valid min heap, and `O` otherwise.

A min heap is defined as a binary tree where every parent node has a value less than or equal to its child nodes. In other words, the minimum value in the tree is always at the root.

Input: 
> The `number of elements` in the array.
>
> `The array`.
Output:
> `1` or `O`
