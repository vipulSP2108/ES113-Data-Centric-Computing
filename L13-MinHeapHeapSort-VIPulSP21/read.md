# Implement heap sort when the input is min heap.

You are given an array `arr` of integers of length `n` which represents a min heap. Your task is to implement Heap Sort and sort the array in ascending order.

A min heap is defined as a binary tree where every parent node has a value less than or equal to its child nodes. In other words, the minimum value in the tree is always at the root.

Input: 
> The `number of elements` in the array.
>
> `Elements representing min heap`.
Output:
> Sorted array

### Examples:

Input:
> 7
> 
> 10 15 35 20 23 37 50

Output:
>10 15 20 23 35 37 50
