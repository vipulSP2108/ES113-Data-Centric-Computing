# Swaps during Partition

You are `given an array`. You have to `partition the array using the first element as the pivot`. 

To this end, use the one pass partition function done in the class. 

You have to `output` the `number of swaps done during the partition`. 

Input: The first input line contain an integer `n(1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)` denoting `array size`. In the second line, `n numbers are separated by a space` as `array elements`.

Output: The `number of swaps during the partition`.

### Examples:

Input : 
>5
>
>3 4 1 2 5

Output : 
>2

Explaination: The pair (4,2) and (3,1) is swapped.

Input : 

>5
>
>1 2 3 4 5
>
Output : 
>0
>
Explaination: No swap is required.
