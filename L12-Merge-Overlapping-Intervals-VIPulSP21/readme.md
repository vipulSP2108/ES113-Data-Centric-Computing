 # Merge Overlapping Intervals

In this problem, you are `given a set of intervals with start and end time`. For example interval `I[i]=[ s[i], f[i] ]` has start time `s[i]` and finish time `f[i]`. You have to merge the intervals which are overlapping and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Input:
> `the number of intervals, say n`
>
> `n intervals with start and end time seperated by a new line`
>
Output:
> `Intervals after merging the overlapping intervals`
>
