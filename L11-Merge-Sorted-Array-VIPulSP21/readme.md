# Merge Sorted Array

You are `given two sorted array` in non-decreasing order. You have to merge them and `output one sorted array` in non-decreasing order. If the size of the first and the second array is `n_1` and `n_2` respectively, then the running time of your algorithm (after taking the input in the arrays) should be `O(n_1+n_2)`.

Input:
> `The number of elements in array 1`
>
> `array 1`
>
> `The number of elements in array 2`
>
> `array 2`
>
Output:
>`merged array`

### Examples:

Input:
> 3
>
> 1 2 3
>
> 3
>
> 2 5 6

Output:
> 1 2 2 3 5 6
