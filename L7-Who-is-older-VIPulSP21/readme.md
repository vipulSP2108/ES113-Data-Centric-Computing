# Who is older?

In this problem, you have to `implement Person class`. Person has `attribute Name and Date of Birth` given in format DD/MM/YYYY.

Use operator overloading of greater than (>) / lesser than (<) to `find` if the first person is older than the second person. 

If same date of birth then return `False`.
